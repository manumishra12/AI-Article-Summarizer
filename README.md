# AI Article Summarizer using OpenAI GPT

## Overview
Welcome to the AI Article Summarizer project leveraging OpenAI's GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) technology. This tool is designed to efficiently condense lengthy articles into concise and coherent summaries, enabling users to grasp key information swiftly.

## Features
- Implementation of OpenAI's GPT model for advanced natural language processing and text summarization.
- Ability to distill extensive articles into succinct and informative summaries.
- Retention of essential context and details from the original text.
- Streamlined solution for processing and summarizing large volumes of text content.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/OpenAI/gpt-3.git
   ```
2. Install necessary dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
1. Initialize the pre-trained GPT model.
2. Input the article text to be summarized.
3. Execute the AI Article Summarizer to generate a concise summary.
4. Review the output summary produced by the model.

## Example
```python
from gpt_model import GPTModel

# Load the pre-trained GPT model
model = GPTModel()

# Input article text
article_text = "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit..."

# Generate summary
summary = model.summarize(article_text)

print(summary)
```
